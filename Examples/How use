This file contains code for an example of how to use the latin_square(), mols() and a = mols_generator() function of square_success
(when copying the lines of code to an IDE, do it per cell, except those that have the try-except format)

pip install git+https://github.com/CesarZarco/lima_latin_sqr.git

from tilima_square.square_success import*

latin_square(3) #Return all latin squares of nxn lenght

try:
    mols(3)
except StopIteration: 
    print('is all')

a = mols_generator(4)

try:
    next(a)
except StopIteration: 
    print('is all')
